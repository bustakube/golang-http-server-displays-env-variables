# Purpose:

This repo holds the code and build/test/push scripts for a simple golang HTTP server that outputs environment variables.

# Overlap:

The build, test and push scripts are duplicates of those in <https://github.com/bustakube/golang-distroless-build-push-and-test-http-app> - the bustakube/golang-distroless-build-push-and-test-http-app repo's versions of those are authoritative.
